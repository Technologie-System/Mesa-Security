# The ***motherboard*** or ***graphics*** card of my pc is ***dead***

### So it will be impossible for me to continue doing the "***game***"

### I couldn’t make a ***3D model*** and ***maps*** until my PC died

### And for lack of ***time*** and ***means*** (Because it's expensive), I ***can’t*** fix it

### But, don’t worry, with ***[SonofPala]*** and ***[ChatGPT]*** (If me and SonofPala don't have idea)

### I ***will*** continue to write ***[Mesa Security]***
