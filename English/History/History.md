#### Chapter 1 - An Ordinary Day: 
Andrew wakes up on the subway, gets off the subway, walks through the city to the town hall, goes to the back and enters the security room on the ground floor.. He equips himself (Weapon, Bulletproof vest and the uniform of the city.) and he goes into the lobby to access the third floor via the elevator.. He comes in and "goes to the third floor".

***

#### Chapter 2 - Power Outage:
But, there is a power outage.. So, Andrew presses the emergency button and he asks the electrician (Lily) what’s wrong.. And in fact, it was only the current that blew, so Lily turns the power back on and she says it was okay to call Andrew.. And, he goes up to the ground floor to see if "everything’s okay"😉.

#### Chapter 3 - Alone In The Building:
Going up with the elevator on the ground floor to see if everything is okay.. Andrew discovers that they were "attacked", everyone is dead.. He calls the police to ask for reinforcements and medical help. Then, he goes to the security room to rearm.. Finally, he leaves on the first floor with the elevator in the lobby.

#### Chapter 4 - The Trouble Begins:
After entering the floor everything is normal, except that when entering an office, Andrew discovers that everyone turned into a zombie.. So, he goes into the security room upstairs and discovers two accountants and Alyson, a security guard.. Then they go to see if there are any people left to save.

#### Chapter 5 - Xen Attack!!!:
On the first floor, there is the accounting department. So, they cross the floor in search of the survivor even if a bunch of zombies bother them.. Their objectives here and to restore the currents.. So, no, it won’t be like that for all floors, otherwise it becomes redundant.. Unfortunately, the two accountants are dead. A whiff for a headcrab.
And the other was crushed by a large cupboard falling from the ceiling. They arrive at the end of the corridor, and have to pass a riddle to remedy the current. Otherwise, it won’t be Half-Life. They discover that the cable of the current and connect to the upstairs cinema for conferences and that full of zombies watch a movie.
And so, he has to launch a homemade bomb by assembling two frag grenades for ventilation. Little easter egg, if he makes the bomb with two flash grenades:
it kills the zombies but not the projector and so, there is also an explosion in the film.
So, we have to make a 5-minute movie and if it goes over 4:50:
Alyson comes into the room and tries to kill them all but they get killed.. Then they go back to the elevator and go to the second floor.

#### Chapter 6 - Ayo, The Pizza Here!:
On the second floor, there is the canteen.. But, it’s weird no zombie in this floor.. Where are they?. So they move forward but, nothing we see just the hole through which is falling the cabinet.. And that is actually fell much higher.. But, otherwise nothing.
And so, when they go into the fridge:
they find the zombies.
Well, it’s a bit like copying Half-Life with the Vortigaunts sequence.
But, there are new frozen zombies (blue).
And so, slay the mini-boss who a big frozen zombie.
It gets a charger with greater capacities for the Glock and the Magnum.
So we go back to the elevator, unless he throws a grenade at the mini-boss.
They go behind the hole caused by the grenade.
And they find the security room.
And if they look at the surveillance cameras:
they see and hear the pizza delivery guy say:

> "Hello, I have 2 four cheeses for a certain-"

And bam, the explosion that Andrew heard earlier.
And that blew the current.
But, who is that person...

#### Chapter 7 - Hello?:
Our protagonists are in the elevator suddenly, a phone call rings.
And at the end of the line is the army and especially Andrew’s former colleagues.
They say who arrived and that they are waiting for him at the entrance.
So they come back down.
The army welcomes them and gives them MP7.
Then, we continue our adventure 5 with 3 friends of Andrew.
This chapter is not very long because it is a cinematic.
And that’s cool because you can see Andrew closer.
Anyway, they go up to the third floor.
