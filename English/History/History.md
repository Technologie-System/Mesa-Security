#### Chapter 2 - Power Outage :
But, there's a power outage. So, Andrew presses the emergency button and Andrew asks the electrician (Lily) what's wrong, and in fact, it was only the power that went out so Lily turns the power back on and she says it's fine and calls him Andrew. And, Andrew goes back upstairs to see if "everything is okay" 😉.

While going back up with the elevator to the ground floor to see if everything is okay, Andrew discovers that they have been "attacked", everyone is dead. Andrew calls the police for backup and medical help. Then, Andrew heads to the security room to rearm himself. Finally, Andrew leaves for the second floor with the lobby elevator.
