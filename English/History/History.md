#### Chapter 1 - An Ordinary Day: 
Andrew wakes up in the subway, gets off the subway, walks through the city to the Facto building, goes to the back of the building and enters the first floor security room. Andrew equips himself (Gun, Body Armor and Facto uniform.) and Andrew goes into the lobby to access the third floor via the elevator. Andrew enters and "goes to the third floor".

#### Chapter 2 - Power Outage:
But, there's a power outage. So, Andrew presses the emergency button and Andrew asks the electrician (Lily) what's wrong, and in fact, it was only the power that went out so Lily turns the power back on and she says it's fine and calls him Andrew. And, Andrew goes back upstairs to see if "everything is okay" 😉.

#### Chapter 3 - Alone In The Building:
While going back up in the elevator to the ground floor to see if everything is okay, Andrew discovers that they have been "attacked", everyone is dead. Andrew calls the police for backup and medical help. Then, Andrew heads to the security room to rearm himself. Finally, Andrew leaves for the second floor with the lobby elevator.

#### Chapter 4 - The Trouble Begins:
After entering the floor, everything is normal, except that when Andrew enters an office, he discovers that everyone, has turned into zombies. So Andrew goes to the security room on the floor and discovers two accountants and a security guard. Then, they leave to see if there are any people left to save.

#### Chapter 5 - Xen Attack!!!:
On the first floor, there is the audit service, so maintains customer and employee.
So they cross the floor looking for the survivor even though a bunch of zombies are bothering them.
Their objectives here and to put the currents back.
So, no, it won’t be like that for all floors, otherwise it becomes redundant.
Unfortunately, both accountants are dead.
A whiff for a headcrab.

#### Chapter 6 - Ayo, The Pizza Here!:
On the second floor is the canteen.
But, it’s weird no zombies on this floor.
Where are they now?
So he’s moving forward but, nothing we can see just the hole through which is falling the cabinet.
And who is actually has fallen much higher.
But, otherwise nothing.
And so, when they go into the fridge:
They find the zombies.
Well, it’s a bit like copying Half-Life with the Vortigaunt sequence.
But, there are new frozen zombies (blue).
And so, slay the mini-boss who a big frozen zombie.
It gets a charger with greater capacities for the Glock and the Magnum.
So we go back to the elevator, unless he throws a grenade at the mini-boss.
That they’re going in the back through the grenade hole.
And they find the security room.
And if they look at the surveillance cameras:
They see and hear the pizza guy say,

> "Hello, I have 2 four cheeses for a certain-"

And bam, an explosion that Andrew heard earlier.
And blew the power.
I'm sorry because the easter egg only work in the version with the name of the chapter.
But, who is this person...

#### Chapter 7 - Hello?:
Our protagonists are in the elevator suddenly, a phone call rings.
And at the end of the line is the army and especially Andrew’s former colleagues.
They say who arrived and they’re waiting at the entrance.
So they come back down. The army welcomes them and gives them MP7.
Then, we continue our adventure to 5 with 3 friends of Andrew.
This chapter is not very long because it is a cinematic.
And that’s cool because you can see Andrew up close.
Anyway, they’re going up to the third floor.
