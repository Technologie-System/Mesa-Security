#### Chapter 1: 
Andrew wakes up in the subway, gets off the subway, walks through the city to the Facto building, goes to the back of the building and enters the first floor security room. He equips himself (Gun, body armor and Facto's uniform.) and goes into the lobby to access the third floor via the elevator. He enters and "goes to the third floor".

#### Chapter 2:
But, there's a power outage. So, Andrew presses the emergency button and he asks the electrician (Lily) what's wrong, with a cinematic, the player takes Lily's body to see what's wrong with the meter, and in fact, it was only the power that went out so Lily puts the power back on and she says she put Andrew back on the phone. Then we go back into her body through the phone. And, we go back up to the ground floor to see if "everything is okay" 😉.

#### Chapter 3:
Going back up with the elevator to the ground floor to see if everything is okay, Andrew discovers that they have been attacked, everyone is dead. He calls the police for backup and medical help. Then, Andrew goes to the security room to rearm himself, but when he opens it, he discovers one of the guards who was in front of the door (the one on the right) bleeding to death, as he has some bullets in his chest. Andrew gives him a medicine to the guard. Finally, Andrew goes to the second floor with the elevator of the hall.
