# Ideas

#### Chapter 1:
* First Map:
  * Andrew wakes up in the subway.
    * So we have to make a subway station.

* Second Map:
  * Andrew walks through the city.
    * So we need to make a living city like in Half-Life 2.

* Third Map:
  * Andrew arrives at the Facto's building and enters from the back.
    * So we need to create a building.

* Fourth Map:
  * Andrew enters, puts on his bulletproof vest, his uniform with the Facto's logo and takes his weapon: (A Glock).
    * Next, we need to make the security room with lockers, gun lockers, restrooms and a first aid box.

* Fifth Map:
  * Andrew goes to the lobby of the building to take the elevator.
    * So we need to make a lobby with:
      * A reception desk
      * An elevator
      * And a part of the outside of the building (But, we can't get there because, the guards prevent us from doing so by telling us that we still have work to do and that we have to go to the third floor).

#### Chapter 2 :
* First Map:
  * On the way up, there is a power outage, so Andrew calls Lily to find out what is wrong.
    * So we need to:
      * Be in the dark.
      * The inside of the elevator.
      * A room where Lily will be.
      * Place Lily.
      * And the beginning of the -3.

* Second Map:
  * At the -3, Lily up to the electric meter and turn on the power.
    * So we have to do the -3 in the dark
      * We have to put :
      * Some archives.
      * Old computers.
      * And an electric meter.

* Second Map On: 
  * After turning the power back on, Lily calls Andrew.
    * So we have to do the second map, but in light.

#### Chapter 3:
* First Map:
  * Andrew goes upstairs to check on everyone. But, when Andrew goes back downstairs, he sees that everyone is dead.
    * So we have to go back to the hall, but add:
      * Bodies.
      * Blood.

* Second Map:
  * Andrew goes into the security room and finds the guard who was in front of the doors (the one on the right) dead.
    * So we need to go back to the security room.

#### Chapter 4:
* First Map:
  * Andrew goes to the second floor, and finds zombies and resistance fighters in the security room.
    * So, we have to do the second floor, place the zombies and the resistance fighters.
