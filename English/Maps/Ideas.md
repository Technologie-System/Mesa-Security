# Ideas

#### Chapter 1:
* First Map:
    * Protagonist wakes up in the subway.
        * So, we have to make a subway station.

* Second Map:
    * The Protagonist walks through the city.
        * So, we need to create a living city like Half-Life 2.

* Third Map:
    * The Protagonist arrives in front of the de Facto building and enters from the back.
        * So you have to create a building.

* Fourth Map:
    * The Protagonist enters, puts on his bulletproof vest, his uniform with the Facto logo and takes his gun: (A Glock).
        * Then, the security room with lockers, gun lockers, toilet and a first aid box must be made.

* Fifth Map:
    * The protagonist goes into the lobby of the building to take the elevator.
        * So, we need to make a lobby with:
            * A reception desk
            * An elevator
            * And a part of the outside of the building (But, we can't access it because, guards prevent us by telling us that we still have work to do and that we have to go to the third floor).

#### Chapter 2 :
* First Map:
    * While going up, there is a power cut, so the Protagonist goes out by the roof of the elevator, goes down by the ladder to the -3.
        * So we need:
            * It must be dark
            * Put the elevator back in the hall
            * A ladder
            * Cables
            * And the beginning of the -3.

* Second Map:
    * At -3, the Protagonist walks to the electric meter and turns the power back on.
        * So, you have to do the -3 in the dark
        * It is necessary to put :
            * Archives
            * Some old computers
            * And an electric meter.

* Third Map: 
    * After turning the power back on, the Protagonist goes back and goes in front of the elevator and presses the button to look for the elevator and by pressing it, it changes the map
        * Therefore, the second map must be made, but in light (A simple copy and paste with some adjustments for the lights).

#### Chapter 3 (In writing...):
* First Map:
    * The Protagonist goes up to the ground floor to tell his superiors that he has turned the power back on. But, when the Protagonist goes back upstairs, he sees that everyone is dead.
        * So, we have to go back to the lobby of the building, but add :
            * Bodies
            * And the doors that access the outside (But, that are blocked).

* Second Map:
    * The Protagonist goes to the security room and finds one of the guards who was in front of the doors, but dies a few seconds later because of the bullets he received and then, he retrieves grenades and bandages.
        * So, we have to take back the security room, but put the body of the guard.
